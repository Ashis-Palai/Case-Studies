```
> **Warning:** Setting `NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall` to `1` makes your system vulnerable.

### **Exploitability**
| Publicly Disclosed | Exploited | Exploitability Assessment |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Yes | Yes | Exploitation Detected |

### **Workarounds**
### **Determine if the Print Spooler Service is Running**
Run the following command in PowerShell:
```powershell
Get-Service -Name Spooler
```
If the service is running, use one of the following options:

### **Option 1 - Disable the Print Spooler Service**
```powershell
Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled
```
**Impact:** Disables both local and remote printing.

### **Option 2 - Disable Inbound Remote Printing via Group Policy**
Configure Group Policy:
```
Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Printers
Disable the "Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections:" policy
```
Restart the Print Spooler service for the policy to take effect.

**Impact:** Blocks remote printing attacks but allows local printing.

### Timeline & Key Developments
#### Initial Discovery & Mitigations
- **June 30, 2021:** CERT Coordination Center ([CERT/CC](https://www.kb.cert.org)) released a [VulNote](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383432) highlighting the vulnerability.
- **July 1, 2021:** Microsoft issued initial guidance, recommending workarounds for unpatched systems.
- **July 2, 2021:** Microsoft revised its mitigation strategies, advising administrators to **disable the Print Spooler service** on Domain Controllers and non-essential systems.

#### CISA‚Äôs Emergency Directive (ED 21-04)
- **January 25, 2022:** The **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** issued [Emergency Directive ED 21-04](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-21-04-mitigate-windows-print-spooler-service-vulnerability).
  - Federal agencies were **required to apply Microsoft‚Äôs July 2021 security updates** and **disable the Print Spooler service** on **Active Directory (AD) Domain Controllers**.
  - CISA urged state and local governments, as well as private sector organizations, to review and implement these mitigation strategies.

### Microsoft‚Äôs Security Updates & Limitations
- Microsoft released **out-of-band security updates** for **CVE-2021-34527** that also include protections for **CVE-2021-1675**.
- Updates were cumulative but **did not** initially cover:
  - **Windows 10 Version 1607**
  - **Windows Server 2012**
  - **Windows Server 2016**
- According to **CERT/CC**, Microsoft's patch only addressed **RCE via SMB and RPC**, but **not** the **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) variant**.
  - For workarounds, see [CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU #383432](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383432).

### Recommended Actions

## üîπ **Security Research & Threat Intelligence**

## üîó [Huntress Security Blog](https://www.huntress.com/blog)  
**Findings:**  
### Overview
- On June 29, Huntress identified a critical remote code execution (RCE) and local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler, known as **PrintNightmare** (CVE-2021-34527). Initially, Microsoft released a patch on June 8 addressing CVE-2021-1675, but this did not fix PrintNightmare.

- Microsoft later issued emergency patches on July 6, but some Windows versions remained unpatched, particularly **Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2012**.

### Impact
PrintNightmare allows:
- **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** Attackers with low-privilege access can escalate to SYSTEM privileges.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially gaining control of **Domain Controllers**.
- **Lateral Movement:** Attackers can pivot across an enterprise network, compromising additional systems.

### Affected Systems
All supported Windows versions are affected, including **Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and Windows Server editions from 2008 to 2019**.

### Exploitation & Proof-of-Concepts
- Multiple **PoCs** were publicly released, including implementations in **Python and C++**.
- The exploit abuses the **Print Spooler service** to load malicious DLLs from an **attacker-controlled SMB share**.
- Security researchers confirmed successful exploitation on **Windows Server 2016 and 2019**.

#### Example Exploit Flow:
1. **Attacker gains low-privilege access** to a Windows machine.
2. **Print Spooler vulnerability is exploited** to drop a malicious DLL.
3. **Malicious DLL executes with SYSTEM privileges**, giving the attacker full control.
4. **Remote attackers can use RCE** to move laterally and attack Domain Controllers.

### Mitigation Steps
#### 1. Disable Print Spooler (Recommended)
**PowerShell Command:**
```powershell
Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled
```
This disables printing functionality but prevents exploitation.

#### 2. Restrict Print Spooler ACLs
To prevent dropping malicious DLLs:
```powershell
$Path = "C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers"
$ACL = Get-Acl $Path
$NewRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule("System", "Modify", "ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit", "None", "Deny")
$ACL.AddAccessRule($NewRule)
Set-Acl $Path $ACL
```
Note: This blocks print driver installations and may cause compatibility issues.

#### 3. Monitor for Exploitation Attempts
Enable **Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational** logging:
```powershell
$logDeets = Get-LogProperties 'Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational'
$logDeets.Enabled = $true
Set-LogProperties -LogDetails $logDeets
```
Additionally, monitor for malicious DLLs in the following directories:
- `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\`
- `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\old`
- `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\new`

**Findings:**  
### Vulnerability Note VU#383432  
**Original Release Date:** 2021-06-30  
**Last Revised:** 2021-08-03  

### Overview
Microsoft Windows Print Spooler service fails to restrict access to printer driver installation functions, allowing a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with **SYSTEM** privileges.

### Description
The **RpcAddPrinterDriverEx()** function installs a printer driver on a system. Attackers can exploit this by:
- Using the **DRIVER_CONTAINER** object to specify a remote driver file.
- Executing arbitrary DLL files with SYSTEM privileges via **spoolsv.exe**.

#### Key Details:
- Original exploit used **RpcAddPrinterDriverEx()**.
- Updated exploit uses **RpcAsyncAddPrinterDriver()** for the same attack.
- **CVE-2021-1675** update does NOT protect against public exploits.
- **CVE-2021-34527** was later released to address a distinct but related issue.

### Impact
A remote authenticated attacker or a local unprivileged user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by exploiting the print spooler vulnerability.

### Exploitability Flowchart
Refer to the following image for exploitability details:

![PrintNightmare Flowchart](https://www.kb.cert.org/static-bigvince-prod-kb-eb/383432_PrintNightmare%20Flowchart-v9.png)

### Solution
#### Apply Microsoft Updates
Microsoft has released patches for **CVE-2021-34527**. However, systems with **NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall** set to a non-zero value remain vulnerable.

#### Workarounds
##### **1. Stop and Disable the Print Spooler Service**
```powershell
Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled
```
Impact: Printing will be disabled both locally and remotely.

##### **2. Disable Inbound Remote Printing via Group Policy**
- Disable "Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections."
- Restart the Print Spooler service for changes to take effect.

Impact: Blocks remote attacks but allows local printing.

##### **3. Block RPC and SMB Ports**
Blocking **135/tcp**, **139/tcp**, and **445/tcp** can prevent remote exploitation but may disrupt Windows services.

##### **4. Enable Security Prompts for Point and Print**
Ensure these registry values are set to **0**:
```plaintext
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint\NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint\UpdatePromptSettings
```

##### **5. Restrict Printer Driver Installation to Administrators**
After installing the patch, set the following registry key:
```plaintext
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint\RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators = 1
```
