# Cybersecurity Research and Threat Intelligence & Hunting

## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to cybersecurity research, threat hunting, and digital defense. This space is a comprehensive documentation hub where I systematically explore the vast landscape of cybersecurity, including vulnerability research, malware analysis, adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and case studies on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. By leveraging resources such as CVE, CWE, NVD, and CISA advisories, I aim to build a deeper understanding of how modern cyberattacks operate and how they can be mitigated.

## Research Focus
### 1. **Vulnerability Analysis**
- **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** In-depth examination of software vulnerabilities to identify potential exploits.
- **References:**
  - CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
  - CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration)
  - NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
  - CISA Advisories

### 2. **Threat Intelligence & Adversarial TTPs**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** Mapping tactics and techniques to real-world cyberattacks.
- **APT Group Research:** Analyzing the behavior and attack vectors of nation-state and financially motivated actors.


## Key Areas of Research
- **Malware Analysis:**
  - Investigating malicious binaries, backdoors, loaders, and rootkits.

- **Threat Hunting:**
  - Utilizing tools such as **MITRE CALDERA**, **Atomic Red Team**, **ELK**, **Splunk**, and **Velociraptor**.
  - Proactive detection of adversarial presence by analyzing logs and attack traces.

- **Threat Intelligence Management:**
  - Leveraging platforms like **MISP** and **OpenCTI** for gathering and correlating threat indicators.
  - Writing and sharing detection rules using **Sigma** and **YARA**.

## Learning Through Case Studies
I emphasize a hands-on approach by examining real-world incidents and attacks. Each case study is structured to cover the following phases:

1. **Theoretical Learning:**
   - Understanding the background and underlying vulnerabilities.
2. **Mapping to Real-World Scenarios:**
   - Correlating attack patterns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
3. **PoC & Exploitation Research:**
   - Recreating exploits in controlled lab environments.
4. **Hands-On Lab & Mitigation:**
   - Implementing defensive strategies to mitigate risks.
5. **Final Report:**
   - Documenting findings, mitigation steps, and lessons learned.

## Contribution & Community Involvement
I actively contribute to the cybersecurity community by:
- Sharing detection methodologies and research findings through blogs and write-ups.
- Developing and refining detection rules (Sigma/YARA) for threat hunting.
- Engaging in CTF platforms to strengthen practical skills.

## Get in Touch
I believe that cybersecurity is a collective effort. I welcome collaboration, knowledge exchange, and feedback. Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, or connect to discuss innovative approaches to tackling emerging cyber threats.
