# Threat Profiling  

## What is Threat Profiling?  
Threat profiling helps organizations understand the types of threats they are likely to face, including specific actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the potential impact of these threats.  

## Why is it Important?  
Understanding threats allows organizations to develop more targeted and effective security strategies and countermeasures.  

## Key Elements of Threat Profiling  
- **Threat Actors:** Identifying threat actors (e.g., hacktivists, cybercriminals, nation-state actors).  
- **Motivations:** Understanding why these actors target an organization.  
- **Capabilities:** Assessing the technical skills and resources of threat actors.  
- **TTPs:** Analyzing the tactics, techniques, and procedures used.  
- **Potential Impact:** Evaluating possible damage from an attack.  

## Benefits of Threat Profiling  
- **Improved Security Posture:** Enables proactive, targeted security strategies.  
- **Resource Prioritization:** Focuses security efforts on critical threats.  
- **Better Decision-Making:** Informs security control selection and incident response planning.  
- **Enhanced Threat Detection and Response:** Improves identification and mitigation of threats.  

## Examples of Threat Profiles  
- **Hacktivist:** Individuals or groups using hacking for activism.  
- **Cybercriminal:** Actors engaging in cybercrime for financial gain.  
- **Nation-State Actor:** Governments or state-sponsored groups conducting cyber operations.  

## How to Build a Threat Profile  
1. **Gather Intelligence:** Collect data from threat intelligence feeds, security reports, and OSINT.  
2. **Analyze Data:** Identify patterns and trends in adversary behavior.  
3. **Create Profiles:** Develop detailed adversary profiles, including characteristics, motivations, and TTPs.  
4. **Share Profiles:** Disseminate information to security teams and stakeholders.  
5. **Continuously Update:** Regularly refine threat profiles as new intelligence emerges.  

### Key Considerations for Threat Profiling  
1. **Risk for the Organization:** Identify potential security risks.  
2. **High-Value Assets:** Prioritize data, network monitoring, malware defense, etc.  
3. **Threat Techniques:** Analyze adversary methods.  
4. **Security Controls:** Implement continuous defensive measures.

## Advanced Threat Profiling Methodology  
- **Profile Includes:** Adversary groups, software, campaigns, and TTPs.  
- **Organizational Context:** Core industry, business mission, technology mapping, network gaps, and defense implementation.  
- **Adversary Analysis:** Collect data on 10-20 threat groups, conduct sandbox analysis, and generate reports.  
- **Evidence Compilation:** Gather an initial broad dataset before narrowing down insights.  
- **TTP Mapping:** Identify common techniques and overlapping tools among adversaries.  
- **Quantification:**  
  - Techniques used by multiple adversaries.  
  - Frequency of use and prioritization.  
  - Indicators for unattributed groups.  

## Filtering Data for Organizational Context  
- Business size, location, and industry sector.  
- Common techniques and related data (adversary, campaign, sub-techniques, and software).  

### Threat Quantification Criteria  
- **Adversary Type:** Direct, proximate, or opportunistic threats.  
- **Capability Density:** Frequency of technique and tool usage.  
- **Impact Potential:** Severity level of threats.  
- **Trends & Activity:** Recent adversary actions.  

### Adversary Behavior Weighting  
- **Impact on CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).**  
- **Defensive Complexity:** Easy vs. complex behaviors (e.g., scripting-based techniques).  
- **Behavioral Chains:** Actions leading to further compromise (e.g., valid accounts â†’ lateral movement).  

## Prioritization Strategy  
- Start with **tactics** relevant to the industry.  
- Narrow down **techniques** and **sub-techniques** based on severity and trends.  

## Continuous Updates  
- Time-stamped attack and tool analysis.  
- Ranking software tools by frequency of use.  
- Evaluating sub-techniques, techniques, and frequency of use.  
- Multiple profiles based on **location, business units, technology departments, and supply chain.**  
- **Automation:** Integrating threat profiling with CVE/CWE mapping and automation scripts.
