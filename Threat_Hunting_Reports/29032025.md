# The Diamond Model

## Event Components

An event consists of the following:
- **Adversary**
- **Victim**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Capability**
- **Metadata**
  - Time (Start/End)
  - Phase
  - Result
  - Direction
  - Methodology
  - Resources

---

## Victim
- **Organization**
- **Host IP**
- **Host Name**
- **Exploited Host Application**
- **TCP Ports Used for Exploitation**

## Adversary
- **Adversary Operator**
- **Adversary Customer** (who benefits from the action, may or may not be the same as the operator)

## Capabilities
- **Tools and Techniques**
- **Capability Capacity** (all possible exploitations of vulnerabilities)
- **Capability Arsenal** (C2 channels, etc.)

## Infrastructure
- **Type 1:** Physical Proximity
- **Type 2:** Indirect Hosting (domains, mail servers, obfuscated resources, etc.)
- **Service Provider:** May wittingly or unwittingly provide services (e.g., internet access to the adversary)

## Victim Attributes
- **Victim Persona:** Industry, Organization, Entity, Person
- **Victim Assets:** Endpoints, Email, IPs, Cloud Storage, etc.
- **Victim Susceptibility:** Exploitable weaknesses

---

## Meta Features
- **Date and Time:** Time-based analysis
- **Phases:** Multiple phases such as Initial Access, Privilege Escalation, Data Exfiltration, etc.
- **Results:** Success, Failure, Unknown (Impacts on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- **Direction:** Seven possible directions:
  - Victim → Infrastructure
  - Infrastructure → Victim
  - Adversary → Infrastructure
  - Infrastructure → Adversary
  - Bidirectional
  - Infrastructure → Infrastructure
  - Unknown
- **Methodology:** Spear Phishing, Content Delivery, User-Redirect Exploit, etc.
- **Resources:**
  - **Software** (Tools, Malware, Scripts)
  - **Knowledge** (Adversary TTPs, Exploits, Techniques)
  - **Funds & Information** (Credentials, Payment Methods)
  - **Hardware** (Workstations, Servers, Modems)
  - **Facilities** (Electricity, Shelter)
  - **Access** (Network Connections via ISPs)

For **quality control**, metadata features can be expanded:
- **Author**
- **Detection Tools**
- **Detection Signatures**
- **Data Sources** that aid in detection

---

## Extended Diamond Model
- **Victim ↔ Adversary** (Socio-Political relationships)
- **Infrastructure ↔ Capability** (Technological relationships)

### Persistent Adversary Metrics
- **Victim-Adversary Relationship:**
  - **Victim of Interest:** Targeted over a long period
  - **Victim of Opportunity:** Targeted for a short duration
- **Cyber Victimology:**
  - Why a particular entity is victimized
  - Identifying common victims
  - Predicting future victims
- **Shared Threat Space:**
  - A common area where victims are targeted (Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can assist)

---

## Technology (Infrastructure to Capability Mapping)
- **HTTP, IP, DNS, etc.**

### Analytical Pivoting
One discovery leads to another:
- **Example:** Victim → Malware → C2 → IP → Adversary

### Approach Variations
- **Victim-Centered Approach:** Focus on victim, use decoys to capture adversary methods
- **Capability-Centered Approach:** Find patterns in malware, encryption, C2 channels, etc.
- **Infrastructure-Centered Approach:** Identify related IPs, domains, and their connection to adversaries
- **Adversary-Centered Approach:** Track known adversaries to identify/mitigate threats
- **Social-Political Centered Approach:** Examine adversary-victim relationships
- **Technology-Centered Approach:** Monitor DNS for anomalies

---

## Activity Thread
- Models attack features with arcs and relationships between events with varying confidence levels
- **Vertical Relationship:** Adversary ↔ Victim
- **Horizontal Relationship:** Multiple victims

### Arcs Represent:
- **Confidence (High/Low)**
- **And/Or Dependencies**
- **Hypothetical/Actual Events**
- **Provides (Resource Relationships)**

### Graph Models
- **Activity Thread Graph:** Definite attacks that have already happened
- **Attack Graph:** All possible attack paths that could occur

### Activity Groups
A collection of diamond events grouped together based on activity threads.

---

## Grouping Process
1. **Analytic Problem**
   - Understanding changes in adversary activity over time
   - Identifying intent and attribution
   - Mapping complete adversary capabilities and infrastructure
   - Verifying cross-adversary capability usage
   - Assessing knowledge gaps in organizational security
   - Automating mitigation strategies
   - Identifying adversaries based on their capabilities
   - Recognizing common processes and resources

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Choosing relevant features for analysis
   - Assigning weightage to prioritize intelligence
   - **Feature Space:** All possible attributes
   - **Feature Vector:** Selected attributes with weighted significance
   - **Outcome:** Solves analytic problems through proper feature selection

3. **Creation of Groups**
   - Groups are created based on feature vectors and analytic goals
   - Formula: **AGS = AGC(PR, FV, ET)**
     - **AGS:** Collection of activity groups
     - **AGC:** Function to create groups
     - **PR:** Analytic Problem
     - **FV:** Feature Vector
     - **ET:** Set of Threads and Events

4. **Growth**
   - Groups expand as new events are detected

5. **Analysis**
   - Utilize tools beyond the diamond model (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, sandbox reports)

6. **Redefinition**
   - Validate results and adjust to avoid overfitting/underfitting

7. **Activity Group Families**
   - Clustering to identify broader threat families

## Benefits of the Diamond Model

1. **Supports JIPOE (Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment)**
   - Identifies intelligence gaps
   - Maps adversary objectives and infrastructure
   - Develops adversary models
   - Determines likely courses of action

2. **Enhances Kill Chain Analysis**
   - Aligns with Kill Chain phases to **Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive, Destroy** attacks

3. **Facilitates Vulnerability Identification**
   - Enables attack scenario simulation for proactive defense
   - Aids in hypothesis testing

---

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Automation & Integration**
   - Incorporate network logs, threat intelligence feeds, research papers, and more
2. **Automated Hypothesis Testing**
3. **Contextual Indicators for Classification**
4. **Redefining Feature Vectors**
   - Continuous evaluation of adversary behavior, infrastructure, and capabilities
5. **Attack Graph Integration with Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Management**
6. **Evolutionary Approach to Threat Modeling**
   - Apply genetic algorithms for adaptive threat intelligence
