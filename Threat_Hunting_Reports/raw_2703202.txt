Threat Actor Profiling
Executive summary
Overview
Victimology (who are the victims locations etc)
APT41 (additional information url ref)
Threat Activity 
   ex- used DUSTPAN and BEACON, dustrap etc
    terat artifcats , dll used 
     called functions , various operations
     basically how the operations at different stages of tactics

MITRE ATTACK Refrence Mapping with Tactics , Techniques , Sub Techniques and procedure

IOCS at various attacks
     Host based
     Network based

Hunting with Yara Rules
    all possible hunting rules for all variants of droppper , packer , loader , exfiltration etc
----------------------------------------------
LLM set up 

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-pip curl wget
sudo apt install -y build-essential (Install build-essential (for compiling llama.cpp))
sudo apt install -y cmake g++ (Install cmake and g++ (required for compiling llama.cpp))

git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git (Clone the llama.cpp Repository)


sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential
cd llama.cpp && mkdir build && cd build

cmake .. (refer to llama.cpp as parenet folder and refer to CMakeLists.txt for building process )
cmake --build . --config Release 

cmake --build . ------->(Builds the project from the build directory (. refers to the current directory).)
--config Release ------> Ensures the build is optimized for performance (faster execution, smaller binary size).

htop  (cpu memory usage)
df -h (disk memory)-
--------------------------------------------------------
manual observations what we need

- we need to capture all essential information from the pages
    CVES , CWES, TTPS , Technology , 

- extarcted urls(white papers, blogs , articles) contains .pdf which contains , figures containing attack flow and 
          code inside the figure which are useful information
- need to focus on headings of the page or documents for use ful information 
- need to extarct different section contains different details(functional , technical) about the group
- need to get the technical details along with all possible codes , pocs , deassembler, decompiler code etc etc 
- need to gather all tools used , and try to underatsnd all new tools,platform , process , all technical terms  
- inside report , facts are being refered from other popular reports  we can extract that also , referel urls related threat actor
- heading extraction , related to prevention and security measure need to be given more importance
- Pdf tables containing useful information also pdf files contains more pages(we can break and create multiple chunk of the whole pdf)
- headings, subheadings, figure, tables , technical codes , code blocks
-----------------------------------------------------
- techniques with code and proof , can be also mapped to MITRE TTPs
- after getting technical details also need to deep dive into step by step implementation 
                        these details can be included in deep technical section 
- Extracted adat from differenet sites can overlap so need unique details with out loosing any data
- data need to be cross verfiifed for technical eveidences also , same code , same process , same files , same IoCs need to be filtered with out loosing unique details

      Shell code execution techniques
          execution using create thread

Technical Analysis of the payloads
      cobalt strike beacon
      scrambleCross or Refactorred crosswalk

Attribution (signs of the theart actor)
      Useof install.bat
      CodeSimilarty to shell code loadder observed earlier or from other reports as well
      Techniques similarity to crosswalk
