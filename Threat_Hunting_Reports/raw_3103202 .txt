What is the Threat
What is the impact , how to mitigate
--- Context and Action are the keys

Context - Includes Diamond models features with cyber kill chain action phases with enough evidence to plan an action and mitigation
           ex- APT X targeting power grid sector using so so tools , during their recon phase then , using powershell to exploit vulnerability CVE-XXXX 
           
Action -
- technical evidence (contextulized IOCS), comprising details about the therat actor indicators
- policy to protect from these types of attack
- behavioural analysis to hunt similar behaviour.
- data collection suggestions to strengthen the analysis and mitigation
- theray scope and risk based analysis to support in strategic decision

Threat Behaviour Analysis :
unknown location , time mismatch , exceess data exfiltartion , insdier threat handling unrelated files

Example Action:
- Monitor and bock ip ranges from XX.XX - XX.XX as per logs and reports from XYZ 
- Patches MS-1234 should be applied based on exploitation of vulnerabiloity CVE-31411
- The adversary targeting power plant , utilising SMB V1 for privilege esacation , SMBv1 traffic an unnecessary permission should be revoked , only unit X nd Y should be communicating with in network thriugh SMB
- Sources(XYZ) says powershell execution is frequent for the attack , so monitoring spawing of powershell is must, better to disable if ncessary

Concious Non -action (aka FUD busting (fear,uncertainty , doubt))
------------
not acting on every news on exploitation unless reliable sources produces the evidence , saving resources , time

Diffrent Reports
------------
Tactical - Aiming to SOC and IR team - Potentiaal IOcs from different sources of investigation
                                     - Technical details or proof on networks and host to monitor and block
                                     - Malware analysis and reverse engineering details to be included for monitoring in detail (API calls , particlaur serviices , DLLS etc)

Operational - Aiming for IR leardership , Network defender etc
                                    - campaign history
                                    - Description about behaviours and various TTPS (spearphising with multi payload , spwaning xyz process for credential dump,then installing backdoor etc etc)
Strategic - Aiming for CISO and equivalent - Intent ,Including Business impact ,, victimology , all business related details affected by adversaries etc



----------------
Detect - detect through therat behaviour analytics also short life spanned IOCS can be included

Respond- With help of threat intel , adversary dwell time reduced and mitigation is quicker having some initial idea where to start

Prevent- 
         - Archtectural decison and tech procurement, gaps and coverage
         - Improved data collection releted to adversary which can aid in investigation and detetction
         - Risk prioritization and adversary performance measurement (blue team & red team) assessment
         - Educate users with real stories about attack and mitigation and how to report or detect these types of attack
         - Build therat models based on actual real world examples not hypothetical scenarios


-------------------------
ICS Industrial control system ThREAT categories:

- Direct -- Adv grp who directly imapct (CRASHOVERRIDE)
-Interersted -- who are gathering information , not disrupting (ex- DragonFly)
-Indirect  --Wannay cry have not impacted but has potential or capability

Threat Intel products
 key elements
    - Data sources (which can related to organization domain specific attacks or related info)
    - Contextaul awareness (Customer or organization's business  to help mapping the intelligence to core business area )   
    -Action Relevance (customers operation to recommend proper action for mitigation and monitoring , attack holes)

CART - Completeness , Accuracy , Relevenace, Timeliness

1)Completeness  - - host , network , malware ,vulnerability , all possible domain analysis 
                - Vulnerability ananysis , CWE analysis , technical indetification , and mitigation 
                -Non Cyber factors -  Geopolitical info , which can lead to potential attacks

2)Accuracy : 
Depends on verified souces 
    -Threat Intel feeds (commercial -FireEye, Recorded Future,mandiant, Open source INT-Alient Vault OTX,IPDB)
    - Internal data (Own logging tools and platforms , like splunk , elk,,Firewall logs , EDR)
    - Govnt & Industry Sources (CISA, NSA , MITRE ATT&CK, ISAC, FS-ISACS, E-ISACS)    
    - more sources confirm the indicators or procedure more it will aid in trust and accuracy

Updated knowlwedge on Indetified Issues:
   - Upto date information and updated information lead to time saving startegies 

Time Bound Threat intelligence:
    - it should mention the time limit or update the time limit to prevent chasing behind out adted or not occuring threat


3) Relevance:
   - sources should be related to the field or sector , rather than aiming for genertoc information of all types of therat(ex- F ISAC for finance , H-ISAC for Health), Internal team soc , SIEM etc can help to provide more sources
   - Contextual knowledge trowards the industry needed (ex- Retail sector realted alerts should have retail knowlwdge to underrtsna the therat)
   - CustomerFeedback - (Pin pointed , relevant therat intel from both direction needed, with proper discussion and feedback , quality of theart intel can be enhanced )

4) Timeliness:
   - fast and accurate machine implemeted reports to respective teams ,SOC and executives (not a lengthy and time consuming report to be digested by respective teams)
   - Fast details from Vendoe , Govnent feeds or public feeds ,and disseminating to respective teams , fast and accurare details
   - Threat action taken immediately , with out holding back for more technical report , as first action should patch or take required mitigation startegy then follow up intelligence questions with more detailed report once its realeased

THREAT INTELLIGNECE ANALYSIS 
-----------------------
MAPPING TO TTP from various reports:

- We need to undertand the behaviour from the reports and try to do some research to understand what adversaries actually doing
- Reasech on their verb part (did this , did that , utlised this , executed this etc)
- Find technical details or meaning of the services , ports , protocols , as much as possible from a reserach point of view
- After enough reserach we need to try to translate the behaviour towards a TACTICS (total 14)
- Then we need to map it to respective technique and sub technique , some times subtechniques can be mapped to multiple tactics , ex - DLL side loading , can be related to , persistance , defense evasion , privilege escalation - as respective dlls can be ovrwritten to perform desired action
- Not every behaviour of an adversary leads a technqie or sub technique , and not necessarily all behaviour should be flagged to alert , some behaviours also possibly not documneted in MITRE ATT&CK , if we have enough evidence from blog post or any technical post we can refer them to MITRE to be documented
- To map to technique and subtechnique we can play a trade off between them to find suitable one sometimes procedure gives better idea and also a generic serach with behavioural details from the blog can also aid in understanding
- For refernce we can refer to MITRE teams' mapping stretegy from "Techniques Used" section
