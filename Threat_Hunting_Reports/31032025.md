# Threat Intelligence

## CART Framework
CART stands for:
- **Completeness**
- **Accuracy**
- **Relevance**
- **Timeliness**

## Key Components of Threat Intelligence
### 1. Understanding the Threat
- **What is the threat?**
- **What is its impact?**
- **How to mitigate it?**

**Context and Action are the keys.**

### 2. Context in Threat Intelligence
Context includes:
- **Diamond Model Features** combined with **Cyber Kill Chain** action phases.
- Providing enough evidence to plan mitigation and response.

**Example:**
- APT X targeting the power grid sector using specific tools during their reconnaissance phase.
- Later, they use PowerShell to exploit vulnerability **CVE-XXXX**.

### 3. Actionable Intelligence
Action involves:
- **Technical evidence** (contextualized IOCs) providing threat actor indicators.
- **Policy recommendations** for protection.
- **Behavioral analysis** to hunt for similar tactics.
- **Data collection suggestions** to strengthen mitigation.
- **Threat scope and risk-based analysis** to aid strategic decision-making.

## Threat Behavior Analysis
Indicators include:
- Unknown locations
- Time mismatches
- Excessive data exfiltration
- Insider threats handling unrelated files

### Example Actions:
- Monitor and block IP ranges based on logs and reports.
- Apply security patches, e.g., **MS-1234** to mitigate **CVE-31411**.
- Restrict SMBv1 traffic in power plants to prevent privilege escalation.
- Monitor PowerShell execution; consider disabling it if necessary.

## Conscious Non-Action (FUD Busting- Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
- Avoid acting on every reported exploit unless reliable sources confirm evidence.
- Helps in resource and time optimization.

## Different Types of Threat Intelligence Reports
### Tactical (for SOC & IR Teams)
- Potential IOCs from multiple sources.
- Technical details on network and host indicators.
- Malware analysis, reverse engineering insights (API calls, DLLs, etc.).

### Operational (for IR Leadership & Defenders)
- Campaign history.
- Detailed behavioral patterns and TTPs (e.g., spear-phishing, credential dumping, backdoor installation).

### Strategic (for CISOs & Executives)
- Adversary intent and business impact.
- Victimology and sector-specific risks.

## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
### Detect
- Use **threat behavior analytics**.
- Include short-lived IOCs when applicable.

### Respond
- Reduce adversary dwell time.
- Use threat intel for faster mitigation.

### Prevent
- Improve architectural decisions, gap analysis, and tech procurement.
- Enhance data collection on adversaries.
- Risk prioritization and adversary performance measurement (Red/Blue Team).
- Educate users with real-world attack scenarios.
- Develop **real-world threat models** instead of hypothetical ones.

## ICS (Industrial Control System) Threat Categories
- **Direct:** Advanced groups that actively disrupt operations (e.g., CRASHOVERRIDE).
- **Interested:** Groups gathering intelligence without immediate disruption (e.g., DragonFly).
- **Indirect:** Threats that haven't yet impacted ICS but have the capability (e.g., WannaCry).

## Threat Intelligence Products
### Key Elements
- **Data sources** relevant to the organization's domain.
- **Contextual awareness** to align intelligence with business objectives.
- **Action relevance** to recommend appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Good Threat Intelligence Measurement (CART)
### 1. Completeness
- Comprehensive analysis across host, network, malware, and vulnerabilities.
- Covers **CWE and CVE** assessments.
- Includes **non-cyber factors** like geopolitical insights.

### 2. Accuracy
- Depends on **verified sources**, such as:
  - **Commercial feeds:** FireEye, Recorded Future, Mandiant
  - **Open-source feeds:** AlienVault OTX, IPDB
  - **Internal logs:** SIEM, ELK, EDR, firewall logs
  - **Government & industry sources:** CISA, NSA, MITRE ATT&CK, ISACs
- Frequent updates ensure relevance.

### 3. Relevance
- **Field-specific intelligence** (e.g., F-ISAC for finance, H-ISAC for healthcare).
- **Industry-specific context** (e.g., retail sector intelligence should include retail-specific threats).
- **Customer feedback loop** enhances quality.

### 4. Timeliness
- **Fast, automated reports** for SOC and executives.
- **Rapid intelligence dissemination** to security teams.
- **Immediate threat response** before detailed reports.

## Threat Intelligence Analysis
### Mapping TTPs from Various Reports
- Research adversary behaviors and techniques.
- Understand **technical details** like services, ports, and protocols.
- Map behaviors to **MITRE ATT&CK Tactics (14 total)**.
- Associate them with **Techniques and Sub-Techniques**.
- Some behaviors may relate to **multiple tactics** (e.g., DLL side-loading affects persistence, defense evasion, and privilege escalation).
- Not all adversary actions result in a known techniqueâ€”some require new documentation.
