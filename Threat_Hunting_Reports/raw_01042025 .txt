CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------
- Biases in CTI:
    -- User biase (interpretation by user )
          - Novelty (focusing towards recent biases), 
          -Availability (What we recall or avilabale to us not focusing towards which we dont recall )
    -- source biase (from the sources we are refering like , vendor repoort , blogs, govnt reports etc)
          - Visibility  (what is being shown on logs or sources , not focusing towards notlogged or not reported or stealthy therat or IOcs)
          - Availability (Focusing on eailsy avilabe sources rather than ignoring the closed sources or other sources which wera are not familiar with)       
          - Victim biase (based on reports towards specific victims like major or wellknown company and theiraffected sectors not focusing on other industry)
          - Novelty (sources reported about newly emerging therats focusing more towards them rather than risk based old therats)

Hedging the Biases:
    -- Collaborate with peers and groups for diversifying the thinking and mitigating novelty and avilability user biases
    -- Diverify sources , Caliberated and Adjusted sources , prioritizing known vs unknown are good practices for source based biases
