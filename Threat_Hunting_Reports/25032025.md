# AWS Privilege Escalation Misconfiguration Analysis

## Overview  
This document provides an analysis of a privilege escalation scenario in AWS due to policy misconfiguration. A normal user with read-only access was mistakenly added to an admin group, allowing the attacker to create a new user with administrative privileges. The steps and forensic evidence are documented below.

---

## Step 1: Initial User Privileges  
The `normal-user` originally had **ReadOnlyAccess** privileges. Below is the evidence confirming this.

## Step 2: Privilege Escalation via Group Misconfiguration  
Due to a misconfiguration, `normal-user` was added to a group that had **AdministratorAccess** permissions. This oversight granted the user full administrative privileges in AWS.

## Step 3: Attacker Creates a New User with Admin Privileges  
The attacker, leveraging the escalated privileges, created a new IAM user named **attacker** and assigned administrator privileges.

## Step 4: Forensic Evidence from AWS CloudTrail  
To gather forensic evidence, AWS CloudTrail logs were reviewed. These logs confirm the unauthorized user creation and privilege escalation activities.

## Conclusion  
This case highlights the importance of proper IAM policy configuration and continuous monitoring of IAM privileges. To mitigate such risks:  
- Regularly audit IAM roles and group memberships.  
- Implement **least privilege** principles.  
- Enable CloudTrail monitoring and set up alerts for privilege changes.  

By following these security best practices, similar privilege escalations can be prevented in the future.
