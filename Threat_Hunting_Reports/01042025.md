# Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis

## Biases in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
### 1. **User Biases** (Interpretation by Analysts)
- **Novelty Bias:** Preference towards recent threats over older but still relevant threats.
- **Availability Bias:** Focusing only on threats that are easily recalled or readily available, ignoring less familiar or unreported threats.

### 2. **Source Biases** (Bias from the Information Sources)
- **Visibility Bias:** Reliance on visible/logged data while overlooking stealthy threats or unreported IOCs.
- **Availability Bias:** Preference for easily accessible sources (e.g., vendor reports, blogs, government reports), ignoring closed or unfamiliar sources.
- **Victim Bias:** Focus on major or well-known companies and their affected sectors, neglecting smaller or less-publicized industries.
- **Novelty Bias:** Over-prioritization of newly emerging threats while underestimating older but still impactful risks.

## Hedging Against Biases
- **Collaboration:** Engage with peer groups and industry professionals to diversify perspectives and mitigate novelty/availability biases.
- **Source Diversification:** Use a mix of **calibrated and adjusted sources**, balancing **known vs. unknown threats** for more comprehensive intelligence.
