# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## üìå Overview
MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally accessible framework designed for understanding adversary behavior and improving cybersecurity defense strategies.

## üîπ Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)
CAR is a useful analytical tool that supports behavioral-based detections and security analytics.

## üìä Use Cases

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Adversary Emulation**
- Simulating attacks by known threat actors to evaluate defenses.
- Strengthening detection and response capabilities.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Red Teaming**
- Developing and testing attack strategies to evade defenses.
- Researching innovative attack methodologies.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Behavioral Analytics Development**
- Moving beyond traditional Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Studying adversary behavior patterns (CAR can serve as a starting point).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Defense Gap Analysis**
- Identifying security blind spots that attackers could exploit.
- Testing security tools against the framework before deployment.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **SOC Defense Assessment**
- Evaluating SOC teams' detection and response capabilities.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Threat Intelligence Enrichment**
- Answering key questions like:
  - What is my organization's defense posture against known threat groups?
  - Which techniques are commonly used across multiple actors?

## üèõÔ∏è ATT&CK Model Structure

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ ATT&CK Matrix**
- A visual representation showing relationships between tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Technology Domains**
- Covers different environments like:
  - Enterprise (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Cloud - AWS, Azure, GCP, SaaS, etc.)
  - Mobile (Android, iOS)
  - Industrial Control Systems (ICS)

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Tactics: "WHY" an attack occurs**
- High-level objectives adversaries aim to achieve (e.g., Initial Access, Execution, Privilege Escalation, etc.).

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Techniques & Sub-techniques: "HOW" an attack is performed**
- Defines methods used to achieve a tactic.
- Example:
  - **OS Credential Dumping (T1003)**
    - Sub-techniques: SAM Dump, Azure AD Credential Dump, LSASS Memory Dump.

### **4.1 Procedures**
- Specific actions taken by adversaries using different tools/software.
- Example:
  - **APT28** used PowerShell (**T1059.001**) to inject into the LSASS.exe process (**T1055**) and dump LSASS memory (**T1003.001**).

### **4.2 Key Facts About Sub-techniques**
- Each sub-technique belongs to a unique parent technique.
- Some sub-techniques apply to multiple tactics (e.g., Scheduled Tasks for Persistence & Privilege Escalation).
- OS-agnostic techniques exist (e.g., MFA Authentication Bypass, C2 Communications).
- **Detection/Mitigation flows upward** (mitigating a sub-technique can mitigate its parent technique).
- **Procedures (tools, software) are specific** (Cobalt Strike performs Process Injection, but adversaries also use Process Injection separately).

## üõë Key ATT&CK Components

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Groups**
- Known adversaries tracked by government and private entities (e.g., APT28, FIN7, Lazarus Group).

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Software**
- Divided into:
  - **Tools** (PsExec, Metasploit, Mimikatz)
  - **Malware** (PlugX, CHOPSTICK, Conti)

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Mitigations**
- Specific strategies to counter techniques and sub-techniques.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ ATT&CK Versioning**
- All objects (software, groups, techniques, etc.) receive updates when functionality changes.

## üß© How Are Techniques & Sub-techniques Defined?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Naming** | Techniques are broad, sub-techniques are specific (e.g., Process Injection ‚Üí Rundll32 Execution). |
| **Level of Abstraction** | Techniques are general, sub-techniques are detailed. |
| **Technical References** | Cross-platform or OS-specific classifications. |
| **Adversary Usage** | Techniques are prioritized based on real-world adoption. |
| **Distinction** | Differentiated by objective, action, use cases, detection methods, and mitigations. |

### Example Distinctions

| Comparison | Example |
|------------|-------------|
| **Objective** | Scheduled Tasks can be used for both Persistence & Discovery. |
| **Action** | Process Injection vs. DLL Sideloading‚Äîboth inject code but execute differently. |
| **Usage** | Credential Dumping (T1003) is widely used, while Clipboard Data Theft (T1115) is rare. |
| **Detection** | Different telemetry sources require different techniques (e.g., DGA-based C2 vs. PowerShell Execution). |
| **Mitigation** | Secure Boot prevents Bootkits (T1542.003), but App Allowlisting prevents Signed Binary Execution (T1218). |

## üîÑ How Are New Techniques/Sub-techniques Added?

- Based on adversary behavior, mitigation, and detection trends.
- Evaluated for security impact and utility to professionals.
- **Example Decision Factors:**
  - Does it improve detection and mitigation strategies?
  - Does it offer practical insights for defenders and red teamers?

## üìù Key Considerations for Analysis

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Adversary Usage Matters**
- Techniques are prioritized based on adversaries' real-world use.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Separating Group & Software-Based Procedures**
- Example:
  - Cobalt Strike (tool) performs Process Injection.
  - FIN7 (threat group) also uses Process Injection.
  - **These must be tracked separately.**

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Adversary Actions**
- Example:
  - C2 communication over HTTP port 8088:
    - Can be categorized as **Non-standard Port Usage**.
    - Or as **Exfiltration over Web Protocols**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Recognizing Alternative Names for Threat Groups**
- Groups may be referenced differently across sources (e.g., APT29 = Cozy Bear).

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Ungrouped Activity Still Provides Intelligence Value**
- Even if an attack isn't linked to a known group, it can still reveal useful patterns.

## üèÜ Example Cases

### **üîπ Process Injection (T1055)**
- Widely used by adversaries to execute malicious code.
- Sub-techniques include:
  - Process Hollowing
  - DLL Injection
  - Hooking

### **üîπ SQL Injection**
- While a major security concern, it's categorized under:
  - **Initial Access** (compromising public-facing applications).
  - **Valid Accounts** (exploiting stored credentials).
