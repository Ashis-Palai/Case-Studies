
THE Diamond Model ::



Event contains below 
-adversary , victim, infra , capability
-meta data - Time start end , phase , result , direction , methodology , resources
---------------------------------

victim --- organisation , host ip , host name, host application exploied , tcp port used for exploitation
adversary - adverary operator , adversary customer(who got benifits from this action), both may or may not same, 
capabilities - tool sand techniques
               ---capability capacity (all possible exploitation of vuls)
               --- Capability arsenal (c2 channels, etc)

infrastructure - type 1(physical proximity) , 
               -type 2 (indirect host , doamin , mail,obfuscated resources etc),
               - service provider (wittingly or unwittingly provide service e.g internet to adversary)
victim --- victim persona (industry , organisation , entity , person)
           victim asset (end point, mail , ip , cloud storage etc)
           victim susceptibility (exploitations options for adversary to exploit)     


meta features
date nd time - time based analysis
phases - 2 or more phases , initial gain , privilege esca , data exfil , etc
results -  (success , failure, unknown) //(C I A compromise) // 
direction - 7 dierctios (vic-infr , infr-victm , adv-infr , infra-adv , bi , infra-infra , unknown)    
methodology - sphear phishing , content delivery , user -redirectional exploit

resources - software, knowledge , funds, informmation(username/pass), hardware(workstations, srevers, modems)
                 facility (electricity , shelter), Acccess thrugh network to connect to victim(ISP )     

for quality control , we can expand mete featires
 - author, detection tool , detection signature, , data source which helps in detection etc


extrended dimaond model
victim-adv (socio-political)
infra- capa (technology)
  
persistent adversary metrics
victim - adver -relation (victim of interes (enduring/long period)t, victim of opportunity (fleeting/short period))
cyber-victimology (why particular enity victimise, common victims, next victims , detective mind set)

shared threat space - common space for victims to be targeted by victims (CTI can be helpful)


Technology (infra to capability)
http, ip , dns etc

analytics pivoting-  one findings lead to discover other features and its details , ex- victim discovers Malware --> c2---> ip-->adversary  


victim centered approach - focus on or decoy on victim to capture adver technology or method

capability centered apprcoach - find the patterns , detailsed investigation , encrypttion , c2 channel etc which can be pivoted to other
                                   capability --> infra , infra --> more victims , 

infra centered appraoch - known ip and related todomain and other ips, infra --> adversaries , infra --> capability etc

adversary ceneterd approach -  track the know adver directly to identify or mitigate therat

social -political centered -  adver - victm releation ship (who may be the victim and who are their adversaries)

technology centered - monitor dns for anomalies

Activity therad - Model fearures with arcs and releation ships between various stages/events of attack with confidence high or low , and steps dependancy with OR AND etc
                  Vertical (adv-victim) , Horizonatl (multiple victims)

arcs - based on  (confidence,And/Or,Hypothetical/Actual,Provides(for resources))

activity therad graph - definite attacked scenario happened already
attack grpah - all possible attach paths that could happen


Activity Group means - set of diamond events , with activity threads  

groups=ing contains 
1.Analytic problem
2.Feature selection
3.Creation
4.Growth
5.Analysis
6.redefinition
7.activity group family

1.Analytic problem

- how the activity changed over time , current vector for the adversry
- intent of thr adversry
- attribution ,means which events and threads
- complete set of capability and infra of adversery
- cross capability verification , (bcse mutli adversries can use same capability)
- knowledge gap of the organization towards adversry campaign
- automated mitigatiion based on adversary
- identify advrsry based on  capabi
- which resources and process are common to idnetify activity and campaign

------------------
2. feature selection: features with weightage aiming for analytic problem for intelligence

feature space - means all possible or included features
feature vector - selected features with weights to priorotize specific grouping
analytic problem - ex - which adversary can use these feature vector? 
outcome - based on right feature vector , analytic problem is solved now

---------------
3. Craetion : (creating groups based on feature vectors created using grouping function)


AGS = AGC(PR,FV,ET) 
AGS --> collections of groups (set of groups)
AGC --> function or model to help with creation
PR --> analytic problem
FV --> Featire vector 
ET --> set of (threads and events)

--------------------
4. Growth: Newly events came so growth of events leads to modification or newly cerated groups

-------------
5. Analysis: 	examine groups with tools beyonddimaond model , like MITRE TTPS , sand box reports , etc

---------
6. redefinition : validate the outcome , checking for overfittinga and underfitiing issues
---------------
7. Activity group families: clusters the groups to find its orginin may be groups are part of broder family


Benifits of Diamond Model:

1)It complements JIPOE (USA DEFENSE)  by considering multiple factors such as 
  -- Intelligence gap (identifying missing event feature, phase gaps etc)
  -- adversary model development (process,tactics and infra etc)
  --infra and capabilities 
  -- identify center of gravity (activity groups)
  -- adversary objectives (diamond model's victimology)
  -- COA , likely course of action (attach graphs which helps all possible paths)

2) Combining with KILL chain gives plan to mitigate the therat
  -- each phase corelated to kill chain we can implement strategies to Detect , Deny , Disrupt , Degrade, Decieve , Destroy the attack

3) Vulnerability identification became easy , Gaming of attack scenarios makes defense future ready and stronger than before , hypothesis testing also helpful with the Model


---------------
Mode of Improvements

1) Automation , integration with diffrent sources , network logs , threat intel blogs papers etc
2) Automated tools can generate hypothesis and test accordingly
3) Contextual indicators integration helps in classificaton
4) redefine feature vectors adversaries behaviour, infra , capabilities etc need to be re evaluate to aid in quality data
5) attack graphs inegration with pen test and vulnerability management
6) Like co evolutionary , prey and predetor model , we need to consider this as evolving in nature so activity threads should be redefined like chromosome , so we need genetic alogorithms
