# Conti Ransomware Summary

## Overview
Conti Ransomware is a sophisticated malware strain associated with the threat actor WIZARD SPIDER. Initially using Ryuk ransomware, the group switched to Conti, leveraging BazarLoader for initial access. Conti is known for its high-speed encryption and its involvement in big-game hunting targeting enterprises.

### Key Points:
- BazarLoader is a common precursor to Conti infections.
- Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools are used for persistence.
- Identity-based attacks leverage SAML, federated sessions, and ticket attacks.
- Technical manuals leaked from the Conti group provide insights into TTPs.

## Threat Hunting Insights
- CrowdStrike reports highlight the use of RMM tools such as:
  - AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Atera, ScreenConnect, Zoho Assist, GoToAssist, Splashtop.
- Threat hunting includes checking for anomalous IAM activities and privilege escalations.

## Cloud Threat Hunting & Intelligence

### 1. Understand Cloud Fundamentals
- Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
- Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-cloud.
- Major Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP.
- IAM, Networking, and Security Best Practices.

### 2. Cloud-Specific Attack Techniques
- Identity-based attacks (MFA fatigue, session hijacking).
- Persistence techniques (backdooring IAM roles).
- Data exfiltration via cloud storage.
- Control plane attacks exploiting management APIs.

### 3. Threat Intelligence & Hunting in Cloud
- Use of cloud telemetry and logs from AWS, Azure, GCP.
- Monitoring for suspicious IAM and API activities.

### 4. Real-World Case Studies
- Analyze real incidents and simulate adversary techniques.
- Write detection rules based on TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Matrix).

### 5. Cloud Threat Hunting Portfolio
- Document tested cloud attack techniques.
- Create detection rules and contribute to open-source research.

### 6. Cloud Incident Response & Defense
- Implement forensics and automated response mechanisms.
- Apply cloud security policies adhering to least privilege and zero trust.
