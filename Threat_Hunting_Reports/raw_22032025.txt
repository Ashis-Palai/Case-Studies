learning on MITRE TACTICS(TA0003) called Persistence (20) techniques and several sub techniques

1- Technique -Account Manioulation 
*************************
1.1- sub tech  -https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001/ (additional cloud credentials)
----------------
case studies for aws 
by adding SSH keys mostly , exploiting unused IAM users in AWS account , cloud trail logs can help to detect
https://expel.com/blog/finding-evil-in-aws/ (expel a leading managed detection and response provider , threat hunter)
https://expel.com/blog/following-cloudtrail-generating-aws-security-signals-sumo-logic/
https://expel.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-expel-soc-alert-aws/ (case studies related crypto miner spinning large EC2 instances using custom created SSH keys)
-------------------------
case studies for solarwind , AZURE AD

manipulation in federation domains (federation trusts),OAuth Apps and Service Prinipal credentials
https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2020/12/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/

the above is related to the famous solarwind supply chain attack with SUNBRUST back door and TERADROP loader for persistence

one more article on Azure AD prev escalation - https://posts.specterops.io/azure-privilege-escalation-via-service-principal-abuse-210ae2be2a5

legacy app not working with MFA using app password instead can be vreached as app password wont be reset with normal password change

rhino lab(company pentests aws hosted application )
https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/ - (how the attacker can gain access and privilege escalation with diffrent ways possible)
https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/Security-Research/blob/master/tools/aws-pentest-tools/aws_escalate.py (privilege escalation vulnerability finder in aws) 
------------------------
https://sysdig.com/blog/scarleteel-2-0/ (sysdig is a CNAPP cloud native application protection platform , cloud threat detection, container,kbn8s )
Scarleteel- a cryptominer using cloud to escate privilege and gaining persistence  
sample scripts by attacket to steal credential , exfiltrate data , clearing evidense and logs etc --- https://github.com/unknownhad/CloudIntel/blob/main/2023/01/10-01-2023
new exfiltration methos --- using termbin.com to exfiltrate data rather than c2
imds (Instance meta data service) V1 is vulnerable than V2 as session token not being used.
pacu - open surce cloud expoitation framework (prev esc and post exploitation)
also imdsv2 has a feature called hop limit , which set to 1 means only from C2 native can request not even from container request can be made as hop count will change 

a tool called peirate --- https://github.com/inguardians/peirates used to pen test kbn8s and can be used as exploitation kit
naming convention with admin_x , admin_y is a potential bypass techniq	
-----------------------------
sts:Getfederationtoken API call to create temp set of credential -- https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/how-adversaries-persist-with-aws-user-federation/
federated session credential are still there even if associated IAM base user credentials are deactivated	
simply deactivating the IAM user is not enough as though federated session this can be manipulated
------------------------------------------------
https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/untangling-iran-apt42-operations

APT 42 posing as journalist and event manger , social eng to get credentials (realted to IRAN middle east & tageting NGOS and govnt) 
back doors used - NICECURL(VBscript based) & TAMECAT	
credential harvesting through spher phising , fake website , fake microsoft/google login page
IOCS - domain releted to APT42 - ksview.top, n9.cl, review.modification-check.online , nterview.site , admin-stable-right.top, shortlinkview.live
