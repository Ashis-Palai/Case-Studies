Threat Profiling

What it is:
Threat profiling helps organizations understand the types of threats they are likely to face, including specific actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the potential impact of these threats. 
Why it's important:
By understanding the threats, organizations can develop more targeted and effective security strategies and countermeasures. 
Key elements of threat profiling:
Threat Actors: Identifying the types of actors (e.g., hacktivists, cybercriminals, nation-state actors) that pose a threat. 
Motivations: Understanding why these actors are targeting the organization. 
Capabilities: Assessing the technical skills and resources of the threat actors. 
TTPs: Analyzing the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the threat actors. 
Potential Impact: Evaluating the potential damage that a successful attack could cause. 
Benefits of Threat Profiling:
Improved Security Posture: Allows for a more proactive and targeted approach to security, rather than reactive measures. 
Resource Prioritization: Helps organizations focus their security resources on the most critical threats and vulnerabilities. 
Better Decision-Making: Provides a more informed basis for making security decisions, such as choosing the right security controls and developing incident response plans. 
Enhanced Threat Detection and Response: Allows for better detection and response to threats by understanding their characteristics and patterns. 
Examples of Threat Profiles:
Hacktivist: Individuals or groups who use hacking for political or social activism. 
Cybercriminal: Individuals or groups who engage in cybercrime for financial gain. 
Nation-State Actor: Governments or state-sponsored organizations that engage in cyberattacks for strategic purposes. 
How to build a threat profile:
Gather intelligence: Collect information about potential threats from various sources, including threat intelligence feeds, security incident reports, and open-source intelligence. 
Analyze the data: Analyze the collected data to identify patterns and trends in threat actor behavior. 
Create profiles: Develop detailed profiles of the identified threats, including their characteristics, motivations, and TTPs. 
Share the profiles: Share the threat profiles with relevant security teams and stakeholders. 
Continuously update: Regularly update the threat profiles as new information becomes available. 

1) Risk for organisation
2) What is the high valued asset (priority to data , network monitoring, malware defense etc)
3) Threat techniques 
4) Based on that what kind of controls we can provide (continuous process)

-----------------------
profile includes - group, software, campaigns,TTPS 
outout starts from simple wordprocessing software to applications with dashboards
orgnaisational context - core industry, business mission or feature enhancement , techinal mapping gaps network mapping etc, defense implementaion (from current to advanced)
collect details for 10-20 adaversaries 
sandbox reports
sanbox analysis
-----------------
initial report or list of all possible details and evidence from where we collected 
broader list need to be analysed as per below
-------------
map adverseries to TTPs and also find common function and overlapping tools used multiple adverseries
quantify the numbers which techues used by which adveseries how many times to prioritize
common techniques and tools can be potential indicator for an unidentified attibuted group

-------------------------------------
a final list of filtered information based on organisation context -- business size , location, industry sector etc 
common teqnuies and with all possible list(list contains adversary or campaign, sub techniques used , software used etc) 
----------------------
quantifization based on below 

-based on direct or proximate or opportunist 
- density of capabilities , how many times used techniques or tools
- impact potential (severity level)
- trend /recent activity

weight adversary behaviour
- Imapct to CIA traid
- Easy to defend against rather than a complex behaviour contains lots of scripting language
- behaviour which leads other action , like valid accouts leads initial entry and then results lateral movement
----------------------------------------
- better to stars with TACTICS allign with the industry
- narrow down towsrds techniques and sub techniques based on points discussed abaove
-------------------------------
-updated data with time and date analysis of attacks or tools campaings(in recent reports etc) etc help prioritize
-software tools ranking based on numbers of gropus and campaigns used them 
- after software density , subtechniques count and techniques count, frequency of use , impact to CIA 
- multiple therat profile based on different factors can aid the defense (based on location, business unit , variuos technology department, supply chain etc)
- automation on therat profiling , CVE, CWE mapping with scripts etc also can be done (find repetative task and automate)
