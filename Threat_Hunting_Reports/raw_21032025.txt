qilin targets VM/ESXis (linux & windows)
rebrand of agenda ransomware operation 2022 (https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/agenda-qilin/)
golang language , spear phishing , citrix , rdp

posting data of victim in its dedicated leak sites(tor.qilin) , golanng & rust
pattern - the file extension being appended, files, extensions and directories to be skipped during the encryption, and the processes and services to be terminated,

The panel's background image features the eponym Chinese legendary 
chimerical creature Qilin (pronounced ‚ÄúKe Lin‚Äù). Despite this Chinese 
mythology reference, Russian language was observed being used by a Qilin operator in 
an underground forum post aimed at hiring affiliates and advertising their RaaS operation[2

Summary of the Attack Flow June 2022
Initial Access ‚Äì Attacker compromises VPN via stolen credentials or vulnerability.
Lateral Movement ‚Äì Gains access to SCCM via RDP.
Privilege Escalation & VM Targeting ‚Äì Targets VMware ESXi, encrypts VMs, and changes root passwords.
Detection & Response ‚Äì Security team notices VM reboots; Darktrace gets involved.
Post-Compromise Analysis ‚Äì Darktrace detects network scanning, malware (SystemBC & Tofsee), and external connections to C2 infrastructure.
Ransomware Execution ‚Äì Attackers encrypt systems and leave ransom notes.

Summary of Attack Flow April-2023
Initial Reconnaissance ‚Äì Attackers performed network scanning to map targets.
Lateral Movement ‚Äì Attackers attempted to spread through SMB, DCE-RPC, and RDP.
Compromising the Domain Controller ‚Äì Attackers issued WMI requests and enumerated SMB shares for further exploitation.
C2 Communication ‚Äì Attackers connected to 184.168.123.0/24, using tools like Cobalt Strike and WebDAV.
Data Exfiltration ‚Äì 30GB of data was stolen using MEGA cloud storage over SSL.
Possible Ransomware Execution ‚Äì Encryption likely occurred outside monitored network segments.

Quick Summary of May 2024 Qilin Ransomware Attack
Initial Access: Attackers used default/admin credentials to access internal systems.
Lateral Movement: Compromised devices performed network scanning, DCE-RPC requests, 
internal RDP connections, and SMB file writes (e.g., "LSM_API_service" for token theft).
Malware Execution: Suspicious executables (a157496.exe, 83b87b2.exe) were transferred internally, 
and PowerShell downloaded a malicious DLL (sihost64.dll) from a domain controller.
C2 Communication:
HTTP/SSL traffic to rare external endpoints linked to Cobalt Strike.
HTTP GET requests for /download/sihost64.dll and other suspicious URIs.
Massive Data Exfiltration:
Over 102 GB transferred via unencrypted FTP to IP: 194.165.16[.]13.
An additional 783 GB exfiltrated over other protocols.
No Ransomware Encryption Observed: Attack focused on data theft over encryption, potentially for extortion.
Attribution: IoCs matched Pistachio Tempest, a financially motivated cybercriminal group known for ransomware, data exfiltration, and extortion.

complement about qilin
‚ÄúThey conduct extensive reconnaissance, disguise their communications with encryption certificates to appear legitimate, 
and carefully choose exactly what to steal before launching the final attack.‚Äù

2) INC ransomware -extortion group
https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/inc-ransom/

also known as gold ionic , ransomware and data extrotion group (since july 2023)
uses adfind(info stealer),PsExec(remote command tool), R clone(cloud storage tool)
target sectors - aerospace and defense, automotive, agriculture and livestock, energy and utilities, healthcare, government and law enforcement, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, technology and IT services, telecommunications, and transportation and logistics.  

uses below ttps------
Initial Access: Exploits public-facing vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-3519 in Citrix NetScaler) or uses phishing attacks to deliver malicious payloads.

Execution: Uses tools like WMIC, Windows Command Shell, and Service Execution to deploy ransomware discreetly, bypassing security controls.

Persistence & Evasion: Maintains access using compromised valid accounts; disables security features (e.g., Windows Defender) 
via SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe; renames malicious files to mimic legitimate ones (e.g., PsExec as ‚Äúwinupd‚Äù).

Discovery: Conducts network reconnaissance using NETSCAN.EXE, RDP for connection testing, and domain enumeration to identify admin accounts.

Lateral Movement: Uses RDP and Lateral Tool Transfer to spread ransomware across the network for widespread disruption.

Data Collection & Exfiltration: Archives stolen data with 7-Zip/WinRAR and uploads it to cloud storage (e.g., Megasync) for extortion leverage.

Impact: Encrypts critical data, demands ransom for decryption, and threatens data exposure to pressure victims into paying quickly.
