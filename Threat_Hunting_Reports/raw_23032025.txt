learning cloud threat hunting and intel

1. Understand Cloud Fundamentals
Start with the basics of cloud computing before diving into threat intelligence. Key areas include:

Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

Cloud Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-cloud

Major Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (GCP)

Identity & Access Management (IAM): Permissions, roles, MFA, federated identity

Networking in the Cloud: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Security Groups, Firewalls

Cloud Security Best Practices: Shared responsibility model, encryption, logging

Recommended Learning Paths:

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)

Google Cloud Digital Leader

Cloud security fundamentals from CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)

2. Learn Cloud-Specific Attack Techniques
Once you understand cloud infrastructure, start exploring real-world cloud attack techniques:

Identity-Based Attacks: MFA fatigue, session hijacking, privilege escalation

Persistence Techniques: Adding federated domains, backdooring IAM roles

Cloud Enumeration: Querying instance metadata, scanning cloud resources

Data Exfiltration: Leveraging cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob) for data theft

Control Plane Attacks: Exploiting management APIs (AWS CLI, Azure CLI)

Lateral Movement in Cloud: Using VMs, containers, and IAM role chaining

Cloud-to-On-Prem Pivoting: Moving from cloud to internal corporate network

Practical Hands-on Labs:

Use Flaws.cloud (AWS misconfigurations)

Azure Security labs (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)

Google Cloud security exercises (Qwiklabs)

Open-source tools: Pacu (AWS attack simulation), PMapper (AWS privilege escalation)

3. Master Threat Intelligence & Hunting in the Cloud
Cloud hunting differs from traditional endpoint hunting. You’ll focus on:

Cloud Telemetry & Logs:

AWS: CloudTrail, GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer

Azure: Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) logs, Defender for Cloud

GCP: Cloud Logging, Security Command Center

TTPs of Cloud Adversaries:

SCATTERED SPIDER: Abusing federated IdPs, exfiltrating cloud secrets

COZY BEAR: Targeting Azure, stealing M365 emails

LAPSUS$: MFA fatigue attacks, social engineering

Threat Hunting Techniques:

Query logs for suspicious IAM activity (unexpected logins, role escalations)

Look for anomalous API calls (mass downloads, permission changes)

Monitor cloud storage for unauthorized access

Detect lateral movement within the cloud & hybrid environments

Tools for Cloud Threat Hunting:

Sigma Rules: Use detections for cloud security events

CrowdStrike Falcon / SentinelOne: EDR with cloud visibility

AWS Security Hub / Azure Sentinel / Chronicle SIEM: Cloud-native SIEMs

BloodHound for Azure (AzureHound): Mapping cloud privilege escalation paths

4. Work on Real-World Case Studies
To solidify your learning, analyze actual cloud attacks and create reports:

Study Incident Reports: Look at CrowdStrike, Mandiant, CISA threat reports

Write Attack Simulations: Simulate adversary techniques in a lab (Purple Teaming)

Practice Threat Intel Research: Track APT groups and their cloud attack trends

5. Build Your Cloud Threat Hunting Portfolio
Document cloud attack techniques you’ve tested in your lab.

Create detection rules based on TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Matrix).

Contribute to open-source security research (e.g., Sigma rules for cloud threats).

Share insights on LinkedIn, Medium, or GitHub.

6. Advance to Cloud Incident Response & Defense
Learn cloud forensics: Analyzing logs, memory dumps, compromised instances

Explore automated response: AWS Lambda, Azure Logic Apps for security automation

Implement cloud security policies: Least privilege, zero trust, security controls

Final Advice for Swift Transition
Set up a cloud lab (AWS free-tier, Azure sandbox, GCP trial)

Follow cloud threat reports (CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Microsoft)

Engage with the security community (Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, blogs)

Get hands-on with cloud security challenges (CTFs, PurpleLabs)
